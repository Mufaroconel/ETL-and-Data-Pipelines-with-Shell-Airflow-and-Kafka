## Data Loading Techniques

### Overview
Learn about various data loading techniques, including batch loading, stream loading, push vs. pull, and parallel loading.

### Full Loading vs. Incremental Loading
- Full loading: Initial history loaded into a database, followed by incremental loading for new or updated data.
- Incremental loading: Appending changes to the target data store, useful for accumulating historical data.

### Batch Loading and Stream Loading
- Batch loading: Data loaded in chunks defined by time windows, while stream loading loads data in real-time.
- Micro-batch loading: For accessing recent data when imminent processes require it.

### Push vs. Pull Data Loading
- Pull: Client initiates request for data from server.
- Push: Server pushes data to client as it becomes available.

### Parallel Loading
Efficient loading of data streams, particularly useful for large volumes or long distances.
