### Batch Versus Streaming Data Pipeline Use Cases

#### Differentiating Between Batch and Streaming Data Pipelines

- **Batch Data Pipelines**:
  - Operate on large datasets as a single unit.
  - Process periodically on fixed schedules or triggered by certain conditions.
  - Suitable for cases not dependent on data recency, where accuracy is critical.
  
- **Streaming Data Pipelines**:
  - Ingest data packets one-by-one rapidly, often in real-time.
  - Used when minimal latency is required, processing records immediately as they occur.
  - Support event streaming for immediate processing and storage for historical analysis.

#### Micro-Batch and Hybrid Lambda Data Pipelines

- **Micro-Batch Processing**:
  - Utilizes small batch sizes and frequent refresh rates for near-real-time processing.
  - Helpful for load balancing and reducing overall latency, suitable for short data windows.

- **Lambda Architecture**:
  - Hybrid approach combining batch and streaming data pipeline methods.
  - Historical data processed in batches, while real-time data streamed to speed layer.
  - Integrated in serving layer to bridge the latency gap between batch and real-time processing.

#### Use Cases

**Batch Data Pipeline Use Cases**:
- Periodic data backups.
- Transaction history loading.
- Customer orders processing.
- Data modeling on slowly varying data.
- Sales and weather forecasting.
- Historical data analysis.
- Diagnostic medical image processing.

**Streaming Data Pipeline Use Cases**:
- Media consumption (movies, music, podcasts).
- Social media feeds and sentiment analysis.
- Fraud detection.
- User behavior analysis and targeted advertising.
- Stock market trading.
- Real-time product pricing.
- Recommender systems.

### Key Learnings

- Batch pipelines prioritize accuracy and are suitable for scenarios where the most recent data is not required.
- Streaming pipelines focus on real-time data processing to meet low latency requirements.
- Micro-batch processing bridges the gap between batch and streaming, offering near-real-time capabilities.
- Lambda architecture is useful for cases requiring access to historical data with speed considerations.
