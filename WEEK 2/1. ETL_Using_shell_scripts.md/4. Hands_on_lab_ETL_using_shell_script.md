# Hands-on Lab: ETL using Shell Scripts

**Estimated time needed:** 30 minutes

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Extract data from a delimited file.
2. Transform text data.
3. Load data into a database using shell commands.

Let's get started!

# To open a new terminal, follow these steps:

1. Click on the menu bar.
2. Select "Terminal" from the dropdown menu.
3. Click on "New Terminal."

This will open a new terminal window at the bottom of the screen. You can then run all the commands provided in the lab instructions in this newly opened terminal.



# Exercise 1 - Extracting data using cut command
The filter command cut helps us extract selected characters or fields from a line of text.

## 1.1 Extracting characters.

The command below shows how to extract the first four characters.
```shell 
1 echo "database" | cut -c1-4
```
Copied!
You should get the string ‘data’ as output.

The command below shows how to extract 5th to 8th characters.
```shell 
1 echo "database" | cut -c5-8
```
Copied!
You should get the string ‘base’ as output.

Non-contiguous characters can be extracted using the comma.

The command below shows how to extract the 1st and 5th characters.
```shell 
1 echo "database" | cut -c1,5
```
Copied!
You get the output : ‘db’

## 1.2. Extracting fields/columns

We can extract a specific column/field from a delimited text file, by mentioning

the delimiter using the ```-d``` option, or
the field number using the ```-f``` option.
The /etc/passwd is a “:” delimited file.

The command below extracts user names (the first field) from /etc/passwd.
```shell 
1 cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd 
```
Copied!
The command below extracts multiple fields 1st, 3rd, and 6th (username, userid, and home directory) from /etc/passwd.
```shell 
1 cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd 
```
Copied!
The command below extracts a range of fields 3rd to 6th (userid, groupid, user description and home directory) from /etc/passwd.
```shell 
1 cut -d":" -f3-6 /etc/passwd 
```




### Exercise 2 - Transforming data using `tr`

`tr` is a filter command used to translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters.

#### 2.1. Translate from one character set to another

The following command translates all lower case alphabets to upper case:

```bash
echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]" 
```

Alternatively, you could also use pre-defined character sets for this purpose:

```bash
echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]" 
```

To translate all upper case alphabets to lower case, you can use:

```bash
echo "Shell Scripting" | tr  "[A-Z]" "[a-z]" 
```

#### 2.2. Squeeze repeating occurrences of characters

The `-s` option replaces a sequence of repeated characters with a single occurrence of that character.

The following command replaces repeat occurrences of 'space' in the output of the `ps` command with one 'space':

```bash
ps | tr -s " "
```

In the above example, the space character within quotes can be replaced with the following: `"[:space:]"`.

#### 2.3. Delete characters

You can delete specified characters using the `-d` option.

The following command deletes all digits:

```bash
echo "My login pin is 5634" | tr -d "[:digit:]"
```

The output will be: `My login pin is`




### Exercise 3 - Start the PostgreSQL database

On the terminal, run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
start_postgres
```

Note down the access information presented towards the end of these messages, especially the `CommandLine:`.

A sample command line displayed looks as given below:

```
psql --username=postgres --host=localhost
```

Running this command from the shell prompt will start the interactive `psql` client which connects to the PostgreSQL server.


### Exercise 4 - Create a table

In this exercise, we will create a table called 'users' in the PostgreSQL database. This table will hold user account information.

#### Step 1: Connect to the database server

Use the connection string saved in the previous exercise to connect to the PostgreSQL server.

```bash
psql --username=postgres --host=localhost
```

You will get the `psql` prompt: `postgres=#`

#### Step 2: Connect to a database

We will use a database called `template1`, which is already available by default.

To connect to this database, run the following command at the `postgres=#` prompt.

```bash
\c template1
```

You will get the following message:

```
You are now connected to database "template1" as user "postgres".
```

Also, your prompt will change to `template1=#`.

#### Step 3: Create the table

Run the following statement at the `template1=#` prompt:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    username VARCHAR(50),
    userid INT,
    homedirectory VARCHAR(100)
);
```

If the table is created successfully, you will get the message:

```
CREATE TABLE
```

#### Step 4: Quit the psql client

To exit the `psql` client and return to the Linux shell, run the following command:

```bash
\q
```


```bash
theia@theiadocker-nyakudyamufa:/home/project$ echo "Shell Scripting" | tr "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"

### Exercise 5 - Loading data into a PostgreSQL table

In this exercise, we will create a shell script named `csv2db.sh` that performs the following tasks:

1. Extracts user information from the `/etc/passwd` file.
2. Saves the extracted data into a CSV file.
3. Transforms the text delimiter from ":" to "," in the CSV file.
4. Loads the data from the CSV file into a table in PostgreSQL database.

#### Step 1: Create a shell script

Create a new file named `csv2db.sh` and add the following comments to describe the script's objective:

```bash
# This script
# Extracts data from /etc/passwd file into a CSV file.
# The CSV data file contains the user name, user id, and 
# home directory of each user account defined in /etc/passwd.
# Transforms the text delimiter from ":" to ",".
# Loads the data from the CSV file into a table in PostgreSQL database.
```

#### Step 2: Extract required user information from /etc/passwd

```bash
# Extract phase
echo "Extracting data"
# Extract the columns 1 (user name), 3 (user id), and 
# 6 (home directory path) from /etc/passwd
cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd 
```

#### Step 3: Redirect the extracted output into a file

```bash
cut -d":" -f1,3,6 /etc/passwd > extracted-data.txt
```

#### Step 4: Transform the data into CSV format

```bash
# Transform phase
echo "Transforming data"
# read the extracted data and replace the colons with commas.
tr ":" "," < extracted-data.txt
```

#### Step 5: Load the data into the table 'users' in PostgreSQL

```bash
# Load phase
echo "Loading data"
# Send the instructions to connect to 'template1' and
# copy the file to the table 'users' through command pipeline.
echo "\c template1;\COPY users  FROM '/home/project/transformed-data.csv' DELIMITERS ',' CSV;" | psql --username=postgres --host=localhost
```

Make sure to replace `/home/project/transformed-data.csv` with the actual path to your transformed CSV file.

Save the file and run the script using:

```bash
bash csv2db.sh
```


To complete Exercise 6 and execute the final script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script `csv2db.sh` by executing the following command:

```bash
bash csv2db.sh
```

2. Verify that the table `users` is populated with the data by running the following command:

```bash
echo '\c template1; \\SELECT * from users;' | psql --username=postgres --host=localhost
```

Congratulations! You have successfully executed the ETL script using shell scripting.
