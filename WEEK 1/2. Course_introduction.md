# Course Introduction

Are you an aspiring Big Data Engineer or Developer interested in creating Data Pipelines for serving Data Warehouses and Data Analytics platforms? Would you like to learn all about ETL and ELT data pipelines and how to build them using Bash scripting and cutting-edge open-source tools such as Apache Airflow and Apache Kafka? This course may be just right for you.

## ETL and ELT Data Pipelines

- **ETL:** Extract, Transform, and Load
  - Curating data from multiple sources
  - Preparing data for integration and loading into a destination platform
- **ELT:** Extract, Load, and Transform
  - Loads the data in its raw format
  - Reserves transformations for users to apply themselves in a 'self-serve analytics' environment

Both ETL and ELT are typical examples of data pipeline deployments.

## Course Content

In this course, you will explore the fundamental principles and techniques behind ETL and ELT processes. You will learn how to construct a basic ETL data pipeline from scratch using Bash shell-scripting. Additionally, you will learn about the tools, technologies, and use cases for the two main paradigms within data pipeline engineering: batch and streaming data pipelines.

## Tools and Technologies Covered

You will further cement this knowledge by exploring and applying two popular open-source data pipeline tools:

1. **Apache Airflow:**
   - Building, putting into production, and monitoring a basic batch ETL workflow
   - Implementing data pipelines using Airflow's central construct of a DAG (directed acyclic graph), consisting of simple Bash tasks and their dependencies

2. **Apache Kafka:**
   - Getting hands-on experience with streaming data pipelines
   - Implementing Kafka's message producers and consumers
   - Creating a Kafka weather topic

## Course Structure

This video and hands-on, lab-based course is made up of 5 modules:

1. **Data Processing Techniques**
2. **ETL & Data Pipelines: Tools and Techniques**
3. **Building Data Pipelines using Apache Airflow**
4. **Building Streaming Pipelines using Apache Kafka**
5. **Final Assignment**

"ETL and Pipelines" will provide you with a great hands-on introduction to the latest technologies in data pipeline engineering.
