# Welcome to Build a DAG Using Airflow

After watching this video, you will be able to:

- Interpret an Airflow pipeline as a Python script that defines an Airflow DAG object.
- List the key components of a DAG definition file.
- Create tasks by instantiating operators in your DAG definition file.
- Set up dependencies amongst tasks.

## Logical Blocks of an Apache Airflow DAG

An Apache Airflow DAG is a Python script which consists of the following logical blocks:

1. **Python library imports**: Import necessary libraries for your DAG, including the `DAG` class from the `airflow` library, operators such as `BashOperator`, and modules like `datetime`.

2. **DAG argument specification**: Specify default arguments for the DAG, such as the owner, start date, retry settings, etc., using a Python dictionary.

3. **DAG definition or instantiation**: Instantiate your workflow as a DAG object, specifying its name, description, default arguments, and scheduling instructions.

4. **Individual task definitions**: Define tasks within your DAG, specifying their IDs, operators, and corresponding commands or actions.

5. **Task pipeline**: Specify dependencies between tasks using the `>>` notation, indicating task dependencies and execution order.

## Implementation of a Simple Apache Airflow Pipeline

Letâ€™s implement a simple Apache Airflow pipeline by writing a DAG definition script named `simple_example_DAG.py`, which:
- Prints a greeting.
- Prints the current date and time.
- Is scheduled to repeat the process every five seconds.

In this video, you learned that:

- An Airflow pipeline is a Python script that instantiates an Airflow DAG object.
- Key components of a DAG definition file are library imports, DAG arguments, DAG and task definitions, and the task pipeline specification.
- You can specify a schedule interval in your DAG definition if you want it to run repeatedly by setting the 'schedule_interval' parameter.
- Tasks are instantiated operators, imported from the Apache Airflow operators module.
