Task 1: Data Ingestion
   - Ingest raw customer data from various sources such as transaction databases, website logs, and social media interactions.
   - Store the raw data in the data lake for centralized storage and accessibility.

Task 2: Data Preprocessing (depends on Task 1)
   - Cleanse and transform the raw data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
   - Load the preprocessed data into the data warehouse for structured storage and efficient querying.

Task 3: Feature Engineering (depends on Task 2)
   - Extract meaningful features from the preprocessed data using techniques such as aggregations, binning, and encoding.
   - Generate new features based on domain knowledge and business requirements.
   - Store the engineered features in the data warehouse for further analysis and modeling.

Task 4: Model Training (depends on Task 3)
   - Train machine learning models using the engineered features to predict customer behavior and preferences.
   - Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Store the trained models and associated metadata in the data warehouse for model versioning and reproducibility.

Task 5: Model Evaluation (depends on Task 4)
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
   - Compare the performance of different models and identify the best-performing model for deployment.
   - Store evaluation metrics and model performance results in the data warehouse for monitoring and tracking.

Task 6: Insights Generation (depends on Task 5)
   - Generate actionable insights and recommendations based on the model predictions and evaluation results.
   - Visualize insights using dashboards and reports for business stakeholders.
   - Store insights and reports in the data warehouse for future reference and decision-making.
