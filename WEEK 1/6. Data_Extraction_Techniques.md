# Data Extraction Techniques

## Learning Objectives
After watching this video, you will be able to:
- List examples of raw data sources
- Describe data extraction techniques
- Relate use cases with data sources and extraction techniques

## Examples of Raw Data Sources
- Archived text and images from paper documents and PDFs
- Web pages, including text, tables, images, and links
- Analog audio and video recordings
- Survey data, statistical, and economic data
- Transactional data from business, financial, real estate, and POS transactions
- Event-based data such as social media streams
- Weather data from weather station networks
- Internet of Things (IoT) sensor streams
- Medical records including prescription history, medical treatments, and medical images
- Personal genetic data encoded in DNA and RNA samples

## Data Extraction Techniques
- Optical character recognition (OCR) for digitizing text from paper documents
- Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for digitizing analog audio recordings
- Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for capturing and digitizing images
- Web scraping to extract text, images, tables, and hyperlinks from web pages
- APIs for extracting data from online repositories, government bureaus, weather networks, etc.
- SQL for querying relational databases and NoSQL for querying non-structured data repositories
- Edge computing devices for extracting features from raw data, reducing data volume
- Biomedical devices like microfluidic arrays for extracting DNA sequences

## Use Cases and Extraction Techniques
- Using APIs to integrate structured data sources into a central repository
- Capturing periodic or asynchronous events with APIs for storing in history archives
- Employing edge computing to reduce data volume from IoT devices by extracting features at the source
- Utilizing medical imaging devices and biometric sensors for diagnostic purposes

## Conclusion
- Raw data sources vary widely, from archived documents to IoT sensor streams and genetic data.
- Data extraction techniques leverage advanced technology like OCR, ADCs, and APIs.
- SQL, NoSQL, web scraping, and APIs are essential for extracting data from various sources.
- Medical imaging and biometric sensors are crucial for diagnostic data acquisition.
