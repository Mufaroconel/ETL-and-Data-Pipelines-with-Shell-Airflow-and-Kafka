# Comparing ETL and ELT

## Learning Objectives
After watching this video, you will be able to:
- List key differences between ETL and ELT
- Describe ELT as an evolution of ETL
- Describe the trending shift from ETL to ELT

## Key Differences between ETL and ELT
1. **Transformation Order**:
   - ETL: Transformations happen within the data pipeline before reaching the destination.
   - ELT: Transformations are decoupled from the data pipeline and occur in the destination environment.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - ETL: Usually a fixed process serving a specific function.
   - ELT: Flexible, making data readily available for self-serve analytics.

3. **Big Data Support**:
   - ETL: Traditionally handles structured, relational data, scalability can be an issue.
   - ELT: Handles any kind of data, leveraging on-demand scalability offered by cloud computing.

4. **Data Discovery and Time-to-Insight**:
   - ETL: Modifications take time and effort, users must wait for changes.
   - ELT: Provides more agility, allowing end users to connect to raw data, create dashboards, and run predictive models themselves.

## Evolution from ETL to ELT
- ELT is a natural evolution of ETL, driven by the demand to release raw data to a wider user base.
- Traditional staging areas in ETL processes resemble modern data lakes.
- Shift towards self-service data platforms favors ELT over conventional ETL.

## Conclusion
- Key differences between ETL and ELT lie in transformation location, flexibility, Big Data support, and time-to-insight.
- The evolution from ETL to ELT is driven by the demand for wider accessibility to raw data.
- Conventional ETL still has its applications but ELT offers more flexibility for self-serve data analytics in real-time.
