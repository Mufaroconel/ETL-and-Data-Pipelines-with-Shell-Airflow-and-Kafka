Submitting a DAG involves copying the Python source file containing the DAG definition into the designated DAGs folder within the AIRFLOW_HOME directory. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to submit a DAG:

1. **Copy the DAG Python file**: Open a terminal and use the `cp` command to copy the DAG Python file (`my_first_dag.py` in this case) into the DAGs folder within the AIRFLOW_HOME directory. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform this operation. If needed, use `sudo` before the `cp` command.

    ```bash
    cp my_first_dag.py $AIRFLOW_HOME/dags
    ```

2. **Verify DAG submission**: After copying the DAG file, verify that it has been successfully submitted by listing all existing DAGs. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    airflow dags list
    ```

    This command should display a list of all available DAGs. Ensure that `my-first-dag` is included in the output.

3. **Verify DAG tasks**: To confirm that the submitted DAG contains the expected tasks, list out all the tasks within the DAG `my-first-dag`. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    airflow tasks list my-first-dag
    ```

    This command should display information about the tasks defined within the DAG, confirming that there are indeed 2 tasks as expected.

Following these steps ensures that the DAG is successfully submitted and available for execution within Apache Airflow.
