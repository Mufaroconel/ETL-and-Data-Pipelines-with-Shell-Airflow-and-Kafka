# ELT Basics

## Learning Objectives
After watching this video, you will be able to:
- Describe what an ELT process is
- List use cases for ELT processes
- Describe why ELT is an emergent trend

## What is an ELT Process?
- **ELT** stands for Extract, Load, and Transform.
- It's an automated data pipeline engineering methodology.
- Similar to ETL, but the order of stages is different.
- Data is acquired and directly loaded into its destination environment.
- Transformation happens on-demand in the destination environment.

## Use Cases for ELT Processes
- Dealing with massive swings in scale in Big Data products
- Calculating real-time analytics on streaming Big Data
- Bringing together highly distributed data sources

## Why is ELT Emerging?
- Cloud computing solutions can handle huge amounts of asynchronous data.
- Cloud resources are practically unlimited and can scale on demand.
- Pay only for the computing resources you use.
- Clean separation between moving and processing data.
- Flexibility in building data products from the same sources.

## Summary
- ELT processes are used for cases where flexibility, speed, and scalability are crucial.
- Cloud-based analytics platforms are well-suited for handling Big Data and ELT processes efficiently.
- ELT is emerging mainly due to advancements in cloud platform technologies.
