# Introduction to Data Transformation Techniques

## Learning Objectives
After watching this video, you will be able to:
- Name data transformation techniques
- Compare schema-on-write vs. schema-on-read
- List ways information can be "lost in transformation"

## Data Transformation Techniques
- **Data Typing**: Casting data to appropriate types (integer, float, string, etc.)
- **Data Structuring**: Converting data formats (JSON, XML, CSV) to database tables
- **Anonymizing and Encrypting**: Ensuring privacy and security
- **Cleaning**: Removing duplicate records and filling missing values
- **Normalizing**: Ensuring units are comparable (e.g., using a common currency)
- **Filtering, Sorting, Aggregating, and Binning**: Accessing data at the right level of detail
- **Joining**: Merging disparate data sources

## Schema-on-Write vs. Schema-on-Read
- **Schema-on-Write**: Conventional approach in ETL pipelines, where data is conformed to a defined schema before loading to a destination (e.g., relational database)
- **Schema-on-Read**: Modern ELT approach, where the schema is applied to raw data after reading, allowing for multiple views of the same source data using ad-hoc schemas

## Ways Information Can be Lost in Transformation
- **Lossy Data Compression**: Converting floating point values to integers, reducing bitrates on audio or video
- **Filtering**: Discarding data permanently instead of temporary selection
- **Aggregation**: Loss of detail (e.g., average yearly sales vs. daily or monthly average)
- **Edge Computing Devices**: False negatives in surveillance devices streaming only alarm signals
- **Other Techniques**: Any transformation that results in reduction of data volume or information content

## Conclusion
- Data transformation involves formatting data for the intended application, employing techniques like typing, structuring, cleaning, and normalizing.
- Schema-on-Write and Schema-on-Read represent different approaches in data processing, each with its own advantages and limitations.
- Information loss can occur in transformation processes due to various factors such as filtering, aggregation, and compression.
