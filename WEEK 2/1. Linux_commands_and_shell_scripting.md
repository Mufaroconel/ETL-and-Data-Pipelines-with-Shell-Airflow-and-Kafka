A shell is a powerful user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It can interpret commands and run other programs. It also enables access to files, utilities, and applications, and is an interactive scripting language. Additionally, you can use a shell to automate tasks. Linux shell commands are used for navigating and working with files and directories. You can also use them for file compression and archiving. 

In this lesson, you will learn about how shell scripting can be used to implement an ETL pipeline, and how ETL scripts or tasks can be scheduled.
