### Introduction to Data Pipelines

- **Definition**: Data pipelines are sequences of processes connected sequentially, where the output of one process becomes the input for the next. 
- **Purpose**: They move or modify data from one place or form to another.
- **Architecture**: Data pipelines are driven by software processes, including commands, programs, and processing threads.
- **Key Performance Considerations**:
  - **Latency**: Total time for a single data packet to pass through the pipeline, influenced by the slowest process.
  - **Throughput**: Amount of data processed per unit of time, increased by processing larger packets.
- **Applications**:
  - Copying data between locations (e.g., file backups).
  - Integrating disparate data sources into data lakes.
  - Moving transactional records to data warehouses.
  - Streaming data from IoT devices for dashboards or alerting systems.
  - Preparing raw data for machine learning.

### Use Cases

- **Simple**: Copying data from one location to another.
- **Complex**: Streaming data for real-time analytics or preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Varied Applications**: Message sending and receiving (e.g., email, SMS), online video meetings.

### Key Learnings

- **Purpose**: Data pipelines move data between locations or formats.
- **Visualization**: Data flows through pipelines as a series of packets, with latency and throughput as key considerations.
- **Design Considerations**: Latency and throughput are crucial for optimizing data pipeline performance.
